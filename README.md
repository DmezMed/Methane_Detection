# Methane Plume Detection 
Code for methane plume detection and quantification using Sentinel-5p (TROPOMI), Sentinel-2, Sentinel-3, and Landsat instrument

## Methane_MSI

The Methane_MSI folder includes code for both Sentinel-2 and Landsat. This code retrieves satellite data from Google Earth Engine, which requires configuring an Earth Engine Python API.

## Sentinel-3 
The Sentinel-3 folder handles the downloading and processing of Sentinel-3 SWIR data. To obtain Sentinel-3 SLSTR observations, the Sentinelsat API https://scihub.copernicus.eu/dhus/#/home must be configured locally by the user.
